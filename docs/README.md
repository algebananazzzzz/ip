This document provides instructions for using FloydAI, a desktop application for task management and interactive AI responses.


FloydAI is more than just a task manager chatbot. It‚Äôs a personal tribute to George Floyd and to all the lives lost too soon to systemic racism and police brutality.

This bot represents the things George Floyd could have achieved, remembered, or dreamed of doing if his life had not been cut short. Each todo, each deadline, and each event is a reminder of how precious time is, and how easily it can be stolen.

### Why FloydAI?
- To keep alive the words ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù as a call for justice üïäÔ∏è
- To reflect on lost potential and the importance of making every moment count
- To show that even in code, we can create spaces that honor memory and meaning
